Ensure that the following tools are installed:

- [STLink Tools](https://github.com/stlink-org/stlink#installation)


Run `setup.sh`

**NOTE**: The below `setup.sh` script assumes you are working with an **STM32F103C8T6** board with a **Linux** machine. If you are working with something else, update the configuration section of the setup script.**
